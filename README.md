# CBYD-Email-for-geoevent
GeoEvent Processor input connector to read and parse Call Before You Dig (CBYD) emails 

This input connector was developed by ESRI under contract with the City of Hartford. The connector connects to an SMTP server mailbox
and reads unread emails. It then parses the text and using GeoEvent Processor can create geometry off the Latitude and Longitude.

The purpose of this extension is to map CBYD requests to determine if they fall within an area that needs to be marked out.
